    "There a disk with origin C, radius R, mass m, rotating with w. How much kinetic energy of rotation is stored in the disk\n",

    "$$K_i = \\frac12 m_i v_i^2 = \\frac12 m_i w^2 r_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice thing about writing in angular velocity is that for all points of the disk, it is the same whereas the velocity is not. Velocity closer to the center is low, further from the center is high. But omega is all the same\n",

    "The subscript c means rotate at axis c\n",

    "### Example: Special Car\n",
    "\n",
    "A car goes down hill. $m = 10^3$ with speed 4 m/s. The bottom of valley is p with h = 500m. When reach point p,\n",

    "$$K_p = \\frac12 mv^2 = \\frac12 \\times 10 ^3 \\times 4^2 = 8000 J$$\n",

    "All those potential energy will be lost by heat if applying brake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can we salvage some energy? Yes, install a flywheel, and convert some gravitational potential energy to the rotational energy of the flywheel\n",

    "We want to convert all the potential energy to it\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac12 Iw^2 = 5 \\times 10^6 \\implies w = 632 rad/s$ and $f = \\frac{w}{2\\pi} \\approx 100Hz$\n",
    "\n",
    "The slow down is not because of the brake dissipitating heat but convertion of gravitational potential energy to rotational energy of the flywheel\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Flywheels\n",
    "\n",
    "R = 2.4m, m = 85e3 kg, f = 6 Hz. With this, we can calculate I, and w, then $K_{rot} = 2 \\times 10^8J$\n",
    "\n",
    "They could convert this rotational energy to magnetic energy. They could dump this magnetic energy back to the flywheels\n",

    "Crab pulsar is radiating out P = 6e31 Watt, which comes from its rotational energy\n",

    "Rotation period of neutron star in the Crab Nebula, T = 0.0335028583 sec. Tomorrow, it will be slowing down by 36.4 nsec. The loss of energy is 6e3 J/sec which is the power recorded in terms of x-rays, gamma rays and other forms of energy. All the energy it radiates is at the expense of rotational kinetic energy\n",
